Objective :
Create a simple student management system using Python that allows users to add, update, delete, and view student records. This project will help you apply fundamental programming concepts, including variables, data types, operators, lists, conditional statements, tuples, sets, and loops. 

Requirements :
The system should store student details, including: 

• Name 

• Roll Number 

• Marks (a list of subject marks) 

• Attendance (a set containing dates of attendance) 

Functionalities to Implement: 
1. Add a Student – Store Name and Roll Number as a tuple. 
2. Update Marks – Store multiple subject marks using a list. 
3. Mark Attendance – Use a set to store attendance dates. 
4. View Student Details – Display student details using loops and conditional 
statements. 
5. Delete a Student Record – Remove a student's record from the system. 

To run the program ,execute python  filename.py
